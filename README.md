# portfolio- app-CI-CD
## Overview
This project is my personal **Portfolio Website**, created to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements.  
It includes sections like **About Me**, **Skills**, **Projects**, and **Contact**, providing a clear view of my professional profile.

The portfolio is designed to be **responsive**, **fast**, and **user-friendly**, ensuring a smooth experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
It highlights my web development abilities, creative design sense, and attention to detail.

The project is deployed using **Jenkins**, implementing a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline.  
Whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins automatically builds and deploys the website to the server, keeping it always up-to-date.
